# School-Schedule

A program that replicates a school setting, but this time tries to randomize students schedule and assign their physical education classes in such a way that social distancing can be practiced at all times

Things that need to be worked on:
1. A front page ( using JS, HTML&CSS ) that show how this works
2. The gym assignment function so that it provides more details
